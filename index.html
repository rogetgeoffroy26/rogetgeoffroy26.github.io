<div id="text2"><p><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/207/">&#187; Website 2</a></p>

<div id="proscons">Pros:</div>
<p>
All the links work properly<br />
The information is accurate and informative <br /></p>

<div id="proscons">Cons:</div>
<p>
Design and Layout looks outdated and jumbled<br />
The organization and font choices of the text don’t work<br />
Overall the website has too much text <br />
and it is confusing to discern information<br />
</p></div>

<div id="text3"><p><a>Review</a></p>


<p>
Website 1 was simple and clean in it’s design,<br />
 had a responsive design which i liked because <br />
 it would be able to viewed on any screen size. <br />
 I also like to color palette and how the information<br />
  is well organized. My only criticism is that it could<br />
   be more interactive and some of the links don’t seem <br />
   to work. Website 2 was a poorly designed website. <br />
   It had an outdated look and layout.<br /> 
   The information was jumbled and confusing<br /> 
   and had too much text everywhere which made<br />
    it difficult to discern information. <br />
    I did like the fact the the information <br />
    given was accurate and all the links <br />
    worked as they’re supposed to. <br />
